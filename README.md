Credit Card Default Prediction
    This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the probability of a credit card holder defaulting on their payment in the next month. The analysis involves extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to develop a robust classification model.

üìä Dataset
    The project utilizes the default of credit card clients.xls dataset. This dataset contains demographic information, credit limit, historical payment status, and bill statements for credit card clients.

    Key Features:
    
        LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit.
        
        SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE: Client's personal information.
        
        PAY_0 to PAY_6: Repayment status from the last six months.
        
        BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement for the last six months.
        
        default payment next month: The target variable (1 for default, 0 for not default).

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
    The analysis follows a structured machine learning workflow:
    
    Data Cleaning:
    
        The initial dataset had an incorrect header row, which was fixed by promoting the first data row to be the column headers.
        
        All columns were converted to a numeric data type to facilitate calculations.
        
        The non-informative ID column was dropped.
    
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering:
    
        Histograms were plotted for all features to understand their distributions.
        
        The LIMIT_BAL feature was found to be highly skewed. A log transformation (np.log) was applied to normalize its distribution, creating a new LIMIT_BAL_log feature. The original LIMIT_BAL column was then dropped.
        
        Boxplots were generated to visually inspect for outliers across all features.
    
    Outlier Treatment:
    
        Outliers can significantly impact model performance. They were handled by capping the values using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Any data point outside the range of Q1‚àí1.5√óIQR and Q3+1.5√óIQR was replaced with the corresponding boundary value.
    
    Feature Scaling:
    
        The features were standardized using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler. This ensures all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.

ü§ñ Modeling and Hyperparameter Tuning
    Model: A Random Forest Classifier was selected for its robustness and ability to handle complex interactions between features.
    
    Hyperparameter Tuning:
    
        The optimal number of trees (n_estimators) in the forest was determined by training multiple models with n_estimators ranging from 1 to 600 (in steps of 10).
        
        The F1-score for both the training and testing sets was plotted against the number of estimators. The optimal value was found to be 210, as it provided a good balance between bias and variance.
    
    Train-Test Split: The data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

üìà Evaluation
    The final Random Forest model was trained with n_estimators=210, criterion='entropy', and max_depth=7. The performance on the test set is summarized below:
    
    Classification Report (Test Set):
        | | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | 0 (No Default)| 0.88 | 0.82 | 0.85 | 4687 |
        | 1 (Default) | 0.48 | 0.60 | 0.53 | 1313 |
        | Accuracy | | | 0.77 | 6000 |
        | Macro Avg | 0.68 | 0.71 | 0.69 | 6000 |
        | Weighted Avg| 0.79 | 0.77 | 0.78 | 6000 |

    The model achieved an F1-score of 0.53 for the positive class (default), indicating a reasonable ability to identify clients who are likely to default.
